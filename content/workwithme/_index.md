#### Learn how to build, manage, and grow a fully distributed and remote team.

I'm driven to educate the world about working remotely successfully as a small and nimble team to large and fast-paced orgs. Through writing about remote work and running remote consulting and strategy sessions with individuals, companies and teams I've formed thinking, frameworks and documentation to solve the hardest of struggles.

Specifically for HR, People Ops, Founders who are in the process of building or looking to improve their remote teams through workshops, documentation, planning and more. We'll work closely to create a plan for you and your team.

#### Experience remote work and learn if it's right for you. 

Breaking into remote work can be hard and time-consuming. It can be even more intimidating if you've never experienced remote work before or are extremely new to it.

I'll teach you over 2 sessions:

- about remote work
- what to expect in a remote environment
- how to know if remote work is a right fit for you.  


This does not guarantee you a job but does allow you to experience and gain exposure to working remotely with a team.

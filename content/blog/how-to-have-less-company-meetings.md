So you’re having trouble with meetings, huh?
<!--more-->

It’s a problem a lot of us have. I have yet to meet 1 person who has meetings, scheduling them, etc. to work perfectly. It's honestly sometimes even worse in a remote setting because I can just pop over to your calendar and pick anytime I please to meet with you.

In the meantime, while that is being figured out, [here](https://blog.flexiple.com/schedule-meetings-like-a-boss/) is a great post by Flexiple on how you can schedule meetings like a BOSS.

Thanks for taking a read! Have a other alternatives to squashing the meeting overload? Tweet me at [@\_justirma](https://twitter.com/_justirma) or let's start a conversation over [email](https://hi@justirma.com) or [coffee](https://calendly.com/_justirma/1on1-call).

Signing off,

Irma
